<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This module provides an interface to the <a href="http://gretl.sourceforge.net/">Gretl</a> API.</p>
<p>What functionality does it provide? Among other things, it offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, determinant, etc.)</li>
<li>Descriptive statistics</li>
<li>Random number generation and distribution functions</li>
<li>Regression analysis, including generalized linear models</li>
</ul>
<p>It does a lot more than that. These are the parts I use.</p>
<p>The original version of this library was written in 2013, and since it has done what I needed it to do, other libraries may now be available that do things better. (I don’t know; I haven’t had a reason to check.)</p>
<h1 id="very-brief-history">Very Brief History</h1>
<p>When I started using D in 2013, I couldn’t find anything that fit my needs, so I started creating bindings to libgretl in my spare time. I chose Gretl because it provided the most convenient interface to LAPACK. Moreover, it was created as an econometrics library, so the more specialized tools fit with what I need to do. I wrote the bindings, added some operator overloading to get convenient syntax for the basic stuff, and I was good to go.</p>
<h1 id="approach">Approach</h1>
<p>I’ve found that it helps to add a section like this to a public project. I’m a believer that the only sensible way to write this type of code is to use the garbage collector. In the cases where that leads to noticeable slowdowns, you can always handle the memory management manually using the functionality provided by Gretl.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> In short, my philosophy is that the garbage collector is your friend. Some minor modifications of the code is necessary if you disagree.</p>
<p>There are two ways to make use of a fast language like D. First, you can use it to write highly optimized code that pushes hardware performance to its limits. Second, you can use it to write code in a fun, convenient manner that runs slower than the optimized stuff, but more than fast enough.</p>
<p>My work falls into the latter camp because my objective function puts weight on developer time and the time it takes to iterate. Simple, specialized functions are preferred to generic code most of the time. The underlying libraries need to be easy to read and modify. Testing is important, but it’s even more important to write code that’s easy to test and less likely to have bugs.</p>
<h1 id="basic-usage">Basic Usage</h1>
<p>This example (coming soon!) works on Ubuntu Linux 18.04. There’s no reason it won’t work with proper modifications elsewhere.</p>
<p>Although I will use Dub, since that’s what the kids use to build D projects these days, I don’t currently have plans to put it on code.dlang.org. It’s open source, so someone willing to volunteer the time should do so. You’ll have to do it the old fashioned way, by cloning this repo and telling Dub where to find it. See below (coming soon!) for Makefile usage.</p>

<li id="fn1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Note that Gretl is a C library, so all memory management is done manually. The functions to manually allocate and free data structures is available if you want to go that route. Alternatively, it’s easy to do reference counting with D - and I’ve done that elsewhere - but it’s not clear there will be any efficiency benefits to doing so. RC adds a lot of overhead. My experience suggests that the real gains come from avoiding the allocation of memory rather than how you manage the freeing of the memory. Pauses in your program are a complete non-issue for these applications. We’re not writing video games.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
