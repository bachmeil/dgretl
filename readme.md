# Overview

This project provides a convenient interface to the functionality of the
[Gretl library](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/). Gretl is a program for
doing statistical and econometric analysis. This package provides bindings
to call the underlying libraries from D, which offers a more pleasant
experience than writing straight C code.

# Platforms

I have successfully compiled and run D programs making use of Gretl
functions on Linux and Windows. Mac should work fine as well, but I've
never tested it.
