# Overview

This project provides a convenient interface to the functionality of the
[Gretl library](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/). Gretl is a program for
doing statistical and econometric analysis. This package provides bindings
to call the underlying libraries from D, which offers a more pleasant
experience than writing straight C code.

# Platforms

I have successfully compiled and run D programs making use of Gretl
functions on Linux and Windows. Mac should work fine as well, but I've
never tested it.



As of right now (2020-07-30) the development of these modules is being done in the localproj repo, where they're being changed as I use them intesively. For now, those changes should be merged back into this repo, but new development should not be done here.
